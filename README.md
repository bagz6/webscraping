# webscraping
Developing a python code for webscraping property price on the internet. Target info to be scraped is title, description, price, location, property type, seller, contact info. <br>
Currently I focused on harnessing the information from the JSON file to get a reliable and easier webscraping. <br>
contact-retriever - ids - restructure.py : grabing information from the website;<br>
retCoorApi.py      : grabing coordinates from the address;<br>
mapping.py         : creating marker on the location of the database on the map
