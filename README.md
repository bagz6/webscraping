# webscraping
Developing a python code for webscraping property price on the internet. Target info to be scraped is title, description, price, location, property type, seller, contact info.
Currently I focused on harnessing the information from the JSON file to get a reliable and easier webscraping.
webscraping-fix.py : grabing information from the website;
retCoorApi.py         : grabing coordinates from the address;
dataSource-rumah   : database after scraping;
dataSource-tanah   : database after scraping;
mapping.py         : creating marker on the location of the database on the map
