## Property Price Webscraping

### Introduction
This coding about property price webscraping is intended to ease my repetitive task at looking for property price on the internet. As a credit analyst, I am required to create an appraisal for property that is used as loan collateral. I am looking at multiple resources to find the suitable price such as going around neighborhood where the property is located, discuss with coworkers whether they know appropriate price for the property, and browsing prices on the internet and cross validate the price with the owner of the property. I intended to reduce repetitive task by using Python programming so that I can effectively browsing for price and work faster.
